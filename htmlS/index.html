                        Early Rock and Roll
                    </h1>
                    <p><b>Rock and Roll</b> is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States during the
                        <b>late 1940s and early 1950s</b>. It originated from African-American music such as <b>jazz,
                            rhythm
                            and
                            blues, boogie-woogie, electric blues, gospel, and jump blues, as well as country music.</b>
                        <br>While rock and roll's formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in
                        country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954. <b>Rock</b> is a
                        broad genre of popular music that originated from <b>"Rock and Roll".</b> Rock was the most
                        popular genre of music in the U.S. and much of the Western world from the 1950s to the 2010s.
                        <b>"Rockabilly"</b> usually refers to the type of rock and roll music
                        which was played and recorded in the mid-1950s primarily by white singers such as <b>Elvis
                            Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis</b>, who drew mainly on the country
                        roots of the music. <b>Presley</b> popularized rock and roll on a wider scale than any other
                        single performer and by 1956, he had emerged as the singing sensation of the nation. In 1956,
                        the arrival of rockabilly was underlined by the success of songs like "Folsom Prison Blues" by
                        Johnny Cash, "Blue Suede Shoes" by Perkins, and the <b>No. 1 hit "Heartbreak Hotel" by Presley.
                            Commentators have traditionally perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and
                            early 1960s. By 1959, <b>the death of Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens in a
                                plane crash, the departure of Elvis for the army.</b></b>

                        British Invasion
                    </h1>
                    <p><b>In the sixties</b> rock music fully completes it's takeover of the popular music charts, with
                        only a minority of albums or songs outside the genre having a major chart impact. <b>Elvis
                            Presley </b>continues to score hits in the early part of the decade, but rock music
                        continues to diversify with the folk revival, the Brill Building sound, Phil Spector's wall of
                        sound, girl groups and surf music, all impacting the early part of the decade. <b>"I Want to
                            Hold Your Hand"</b> was <b>the Beatles' first number one hit</b> on the Billboard Hot 100,
                        spending seven weeks at the top and a total of 15 weeks on the chart.<br><b>Beatlemania hits the
                            US</b> as the UK group scores six number one US hits in 1964. Televison is influential with
                        new primetime music shows, and The Beatles first Ed Sullivan appearance breaking TV ratings
                        records.The <b>British Invasion </b>begins as more UK rock acts follow The Beatles to US chart
                        success. Hence, By 1964 American artists were sharing the top of the charts with U.K. bands led
                        by <b>the Beatles</b> and<b> The Rolling Stones</b>. Soon these groups were composing their own
                        material, combining US forms of music and infusing it with a high energy beat. The British
                        Invasion helped <b>internationalize</b> the production of rock and roll, opening the door for
                        subsequent British (and Irish) performers to achieve international success. It dented the
                        careers of established R&B acts like Fats Domino and Chubby Checker and even temporarily
                        derailed the chart success of surviving rock and roll acts, <b>including Elvis.</b>

                    </h1>
                    <p><b>The Beatles break up</b> in 1970, but all four members continue to impact the decade with
                        successful solo careers. The early seventies are marked by the <b>deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Janis
                            Joplin and Jim Morrison</b> who all die at the age of 27.<br> The decade is often referred
                        to as the <b>“Golden Age of Rock”</b> due to the incredible number of iconic and influential
                        bands that emerged, including <b>Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Who, The Rolling Stones,
                            Aerosmith, and Queen</b>. <b>Nostalgia for rock's earlier days</b> grows in the seventies.
                        <b>Compilation albums</b> of various artists and musical styles are popular. The 1970s are
                        regarded as a <b>pivotal decade</b> in rock music history, <b>marked by innovation, creativity,
                            and a sense of rebellion</b>, which <b>laid the groundwork for the diverse range of rock
                            styles</b> that followed. <b>Rock concerts move from theaters and clubs, to sports
                            arenas.</b> The <b>1970s were known for their epic live shows</b>, with many bands pushing
                        the boundaries of concert production, sound, and lighting. <b>July 1973, Led Zeppelin play to
                            56,800</b> at Tampa Stadium, <b>breaking the Beatles Shea Stadium record</b> for largest
                        concert attendance. <b>Elvis Presley dies suddenly in 1977 at age 42</b>. Huge crowds begin
                        flocking to his Memphis home, <b>Graceland</b>, which continues to be a <b>tourist destination
                            to this day.</b> By the end of the 70's, <b>Disco dominated the singles charts</b> and many
                        rock acts score with disco style hits, <b>including Blondie, Rod Stewart, Electric Light
                            Orchestra, Kenny Rogers and even Kiss.</b>
